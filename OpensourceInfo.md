Welcome to the Off-Day Contribution Page!

Off-Day is an open source Program that welcome users contribution. We have utilized the Ruby on Rails Platform to create the initial launch for Off-Day. 


Contact Information: Off-DaySupport@gmail.com
Slack Server Invation: Invitation-Off-day.slack.com/invite/12345

For Aspiring Contributors:

In order to be considered as a contributor, Off-Day requires that you submit a formal request via email or our slack server.
The Request must be formatted as followed:

1. Github name
2. Planned Implementation Design
3. Estimated Completion Date
4. Any Software or Developer Specific Requests


Currently Off-Day needs to have some current issues and planned implementation completed before we want to expand the project further.
With this in mind, we still welcome requests that are not current issues, yet we do request that these issues are fixed beforehand.


Once a Requested Contribution is approved, we have team to review the pull request. Code reviews will be assesed based on the following criteria:

1. General Programming Practices: If the request program does not follow standard Software Engineering guidelines, then it is possible that the pull request gets denied.
2. Scalability: Any implementation should be implemented in a dynamic fashion: nothing "hard-coded" and everything should support manageable scalability.
3. Modularity: Implementation must be implemented in a modular fashion. Code should not be too large, but broken up into smaller modules. 
4. Security Clearance: Once the code is reviewed for Steps 1-3, a security check is run on any new implementation. It should be expected that any user input is filtered, cryptography is used when needed, and general secure programming practices are put in place.

Most communication will be done via the Slack Channel. We will periodically update Milestones and Issues to help keep open source contributors on track and in the loop of communication. Any questions can be sent directly to our support email, Off-DaySupport@gmail.com or in our #ContributorHelp slack channel.

We sincerely thank any aspiring contributors for developing Off-Day!
