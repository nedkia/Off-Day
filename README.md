Protype 2 Design: In This design I focused on implementing and creating my database tables as well implementing inserts, deletes, and searches for the database.
I began to create my user diagram and I implemented basic pages.

=======
Welcome to OFF-DAY!


This Program allows a person to input various "off" feeling symptoms and it will produce a quick and easy diagnoses!

Users will first select a body category where they are feeling symptomatic. They will then choose from a list a symptoms and after choosing their symptoms, they will be redirected to a page that displays the correct safety measures to do in response to feeling this symptom.

The goal of this tool is to be a simple, quick and easy way to self-diagnose "off" symptoms in order to prevent medical accidents and other related issues.
